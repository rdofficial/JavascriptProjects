# Login System - NodeJS

It is a user authentication system where users can login to their respective user accounts. User authentication is very common in modern web application. It is a security mechanism that is used to restrict unauthorized access to member-only areas and tools on a site. Generally, all websites use this feature, you would mostly know this feature from popular web services like FaceBook, Instagram, Twitter. Our project is not that big LOL!, but we will atleast learn how to authenticate user accounts on a basic level. The project is for learners and beginners in NodeJs or Web Developement.

## Note

Some points to be noted about this project are listed below.

* __Basic Concepts :__ Even though the project is built under NodeJs technology, but the codes and functions used in the project are simple and easy to understand for a beginner in web developement. The application does not uses any other modules or frameworks like _passport.js_ or _socket.io_, we only used _express.js_ for creating the web application with _ejs_ as the template rendering. For the frontend designing, we later relied on _Bootstrap_, this made our one side of hardwork making the web application easy.

* __No usage of database :-__ The entire login system is made without using any external database system. Now, things might not be too much relevant to you. So, let me exolain. In order to authenticate the users to allow login access to their accounts, we should have the details of each and every user account in our web server's database. Almost every login system uses the database servers like MySQL, MariaDB, MongoDB, etc. But, we here are using _JSON_ files to store the user's data. This reduces our efforts of learning another database technology for fullfilling the purpose.

* __Youtube Tutorials :-__ Yes, you've read it right! We have the tutorials of making this web application (OR you can call project), uploaded at [my youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCfp-xR7cpyLOXVW8MYr59WA). You can check it out and get a practical experience of the things that are being done on the screen.

## About author

The application is written by Rishav Das. I am a programmer and know python (django, general based, data science), javascript (nodeJs), PHP, C, C++. I have written this tool in intention to expertise the javascript language for the beginners. The tool does not need you to learn any server side programming or any sockets / nodes stuff. If you are new to javascript, here is your first project to start off ;-). I have made several beginner level javascript projects and all are available at my [github profile](https://github.com/rdofficial). One more thing about these projects are that the tutorials of making these projects including coding section, mathematical section are uploaded to [my youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCfp-xR7cpyLOXVW8MYr59WA). If you haven't checked out my videos, check them out on my channel, you would get a better practical experience for the projects.

For the contributors, if you want to update any stuff on these projects, you can just create a pull request or just mail me at _rdofficial192@gmail.com_ with the updates. I'll check it out as soon as possible.
