A tool which helps you to keep logs of watchlist of your favourite films. This tool is a perfect project for beginners (freshers) in javascript programming. The tool is made using VanillaJs and also the application does uses a backend database, it just stores the data at the local storage of your web browser.

## Note

Some points to be noted about this application are listed below :
* __Local Storage :-__ The application uses local storage of the web browser to store the watchlist data, thus the codes of the program is very simple and does not require any remote database system being run on background. Also, note if we format the local cache of the web browser, all the data saved by the tool will also be vanished :-/.

* __VanillaJs :-__ The application is written in pure client side javascript, which makes the source code very easy to understand for beginners to javascript programming. The beginners can use this project for their learning purposes, as this project is not meant for production purposes, it is created solely for the beginners to learn javascript properly and also grab its concept of application (uses of certain code structure).

## About the author

The tool is written by Rishav Das. I am a programmer and know python (django, general based, data science), javascript (nodeJs), PHP, C, C++. I have written this tool in intention to expertise the javascript language for the beginners. The tool does not need you to learn any server side programming or any sockets / nodes stuff. If you are new to javascript, here is your first project to start off ;-). I have made several beginner level javascript projects and all are available at my [github profile](https://github.com/rdofficial). One more thing about these projects are that the tutorials of making these projects including coding section, mathematical section are uploaded to [my youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCfp-xR7cpyLOXVW8MYr59WA). If you haven't checked out my videos, check them out on my channel, you would get a better practical experience for the projects.
